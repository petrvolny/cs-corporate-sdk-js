# CSCorporateSDK
This SDK allows you to access information about Česká spořitelna a.s. Corporate API [Corporate API](https://developers.erstegroup.com/docs/apis/bank.csas/v1%2Fcorporate).

Fot current changes in the SDK see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

# Usage

If you just want to use the SDK, there are compiled files ready to be used in the [`/dist`](./dist) folder.

You can just copy these files directly from the repository or preferably, use `npm` to install it into your project:

```
npm install https://github.com/Ceskasporitelna/cs-corporate-sdk-js.git --save
```

## Usage in browser
For usage in browser, pickup the following files from the `/dist` folder:
* `cs-corporate-sdk.sfx.js` - CSCorporateSDK packaged for browsers
* `cs-corporate-sdk.sfx.d.ts` - CSCorporateSDK typings for browsers
* `cs-corporate-sdk.sfx.js.map` - CSCorporateSDK sourcemap for browsers


Corporate SDK is dependent on the [CSCoreSDK](https://github.com/Ceskasporitelna/cs-core-sdk-js). 
You can find the appropriate verion of CSCoreSDK in `node_modules` of corporate SDK if you installed it through `npm`.
Include the `cs-core-sdk.sfx.js` in your page **before** the `cs-corporate-sdk.sfx.js`:

```html
  <script src="./node_modules/cs-corporate-sdk/node_modules/cs-core-sdk/dist/cs-core-sdk.sfx.js"></script>
  <script src="./node_modules/cs-corporate-sdk/dist/cs-corporate-sdk.sfx.js"></script>
```

The corporate SDK will be available in global variable `CSCorporateSDK`.

**IMPORTANT!** CSAS SDKs depend on a native ES6 Promise implementation to be [supported](http://caniuse.com/promises).
If your environment doesn't support ES6 Promises, you can [polyfill](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise).

## Usage in node
For usage in node, install it through `npm` (see above). You can then require it by:
```javascript
var CSCorporateSDK = require('cs-corporate-sdk');
``` 


## Configuration
Before using any CSAS SDKs in your application, you need to initialize CSCoreSDK by providing it your WebApiKey.
```javascript
CSCoreSDK.useWebApiKey( "YourApiKey" )
//Get the corporate client
var corporateClient = CSCorporateSDK.getClient();
```
